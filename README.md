# Setup Guide for Local Development

This README will guide you through setting up the project on your local computer. It includes the creation of a virtual environment, installation of dependencies, and troubleshooting steps.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python's package manager)
- PowerShell (for Windows users)
- Terminal or Bash (for macOS/Linux users)

## Steps to Set Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

#### For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python3 -m venv llm-venv
```

#### For macOS/Linux (Terminal):

```bash
python3 -m venv llm-venv
```

This will create a new virtual environment called `llm-venv`.

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

#### For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\llm-venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### For macOS/Linux (Terminal):

```bash
source llm-venv/bin/activate
```

You should now see `(llm-venv)` in your terminal, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages by using the `requirements.txt` file. This file contains all the packages required for the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note:* If you haven't already installed the `opencv-python` and `onnxruntime` libraries, you can manually install them by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python onnxruntime
```

### 5. Check for Missing Files

You might encounter errors if certain files are missing. For example, the `config.yaml` file was not found initially. You can manually create the `config.yaml` file in the project directory with the following format:

```yaml
api_key: "EJ1VK5N-D084RGH-NKJDTGB-SV282YJ"
model_server_base_url: "http://localhost:3001/api/v1"
workspace_slug: "aihackathon"
```

If you already have this file in another location, you can copy it into the project directory:

#### For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path C:\path\to\config.yaml -Destination .
```

#### For macOS/Linux (Terminal):

```bash
cp /path/to/config.yaml .
```

### 6. Running the Code

To run the chatbot script, use the following command:

```bash
python3 ./src/terminal_chatbot.py
```

This should start the chatbot, and you should be able to interact with it.

### 7. Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: If you encounter an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`, make sure that the virtual environment is activated and that all dependencies are installed by running:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Missing `config.yaml`**: If the script asks for the `config.yaml` file, ensure it is manually created with the format provided in Step 5.

- **PowerShell Execution Policy (Windows Only)**: If you get an error when activating the virtual environment in PowerShell, you might need to adjust your execution policy. Run the following command in PowerShell as Administrator:

  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

This will allow you to run the script.

- **Checking Python Version and Path**: If you encounter issues with running Python scripts, confirm that you are using the correct Python version and virtual environment:

#### For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python3 --version
where python3
```

#### For macOS/Linux (Terminal):

```bash
python3 --version
which python3
```

---

Now your environment should be set up and running! You can start interacting with the chatbot or work on other features of the project.
